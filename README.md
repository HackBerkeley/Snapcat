# Snapcat
An iOS workshop by Luke Brody

Check out and introduction to Swift in `SwiftIntroduction.playground`, and then move on to an introduction to `CALayer` in `CALayer.playground`.

Then, check out the Snapcat code by opening the Xcode project.

Special thanks to Jessie Yang for the awesome cat graphics!
